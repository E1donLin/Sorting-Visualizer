### This project is inspired by ClÃ©ment Mihailescu

  I came across with this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXYym4Wbkc&t=1466s) and I thought that the app was pretty cool, and I decided to create my own    version of sorting algorithm visualizer.

### Purpose of this project
  This project helps beginners understand how different algorithms work behind the scene by showing the animations of each algorithm.

  Algorithms included:
  > - Bubble Sort
  > - Insertion Sort
  > - Selection Sort
  > - Merge Sort
  > - Quick Sort

### Technology:
  > - React with hooks
  > - Material UI
  > - JavaScript generator function
